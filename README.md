# Jobs in Software Development

Software Engineering is, as we've seen many times, a large and expansive fields concerning many disciplines. Past that, the process of software development has grown to one of the largest industries in the world, and requires a support positions in every business field, many or which require an understanding of software engineering.

Many students get caught up in the idea that the only job they can get with their training is straight development, when this is not the case.  Let's look at some of the many software engineering jobs available to those with our knowledge.

## Direct Software Engineering Jobs

While there are many support roles, there are also many different jobs where the bulk of the work is actually writing and working with code.

### Web Developer

Probably the first thought and main focus of most TechHire graduates, and the field that you're best trained to do. Web development is the coding job that requires the least computer science knowledge, at least for entry-level positions, and is the most common entry point into software engineering.  Within web development, there are still plenty of specializations, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack, among others.

Median salaries in NYC for web developers:

- Front-end: $89,000
- Back-end: $112,000
- Full-stack: $115,000

### Wordpress (and other content management) Developer

Roughly a third of websites that exist are Wordpress websites.  While it's possible to create a site on Wordpress without coding knowledge, more complicated Wordpress sites require a developer. Unlike traditional web developers who develop sites from scratch, Wordpress developers work mostly on integrations and plugin development the Wordpress provides. 

Wordpress developers create the front and back end, and can also work on design.  Some developer work mostly on creating themes for Wordpress, which are color and text templates that can be used on the site.

This kind of developer uses the WordPress system, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

### Mobile Developer

Mobile developers work in the creation on mobile apps.  A lot of mobile development is similar to the development of computer software, as it runs on the device's operating system.  This involves an understanding of Android and iOS and the development environment used in these systems.  Languages used in mobile development include Java, Swift, and Objective-C.

However, there are ways to write mobile apps using the web development languages we know, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The most popular of these methods is React Native, which allows the writing of mobile apps in React.

## Indirect Software Engineering Jobs

### DevOps

DevOps engineers are, simply put, the engineers that deploy the website.  The job exists as a hybrid of coding and IT, and is concerned with the speedy and error-free operation of the live site in operation. This can involve working with hosting sites like AWS or heroku, or can even mean working directly with the servers that run the site.

Most DevOps need a strong knowledge of back-end systems, as these databases and APIs require the most management in terms of hosting and serving.

Other technologies used by DevOps Engineers include Kubernetes, Docker, Apache Mesos, AWS, etc.

### QA 

QA engineers manually test softwares and services by using the site as a user would, and running through the possible scenarios that the site may see. While this job does not require as much engineering training as the others on this list, experience in software engineering is a strong plus as it allows the QA engineer to better diagnose the problems they might encounter and communicate with the dev staff.

### Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)

SDETs are developers with the responsibility of writing frameworks and tools to test products and validate the functionality of systems. They create automated tests, tools and systems to make sure that products and processes run as expected.

SDETs are expected to understand software internals, debug code, automate repetitive tasks, and implement new tools and frameworks needed to streamline development. SDETs usually work directly with both Software Development Engineers and Quality Assurance Engineers to make sure that product expectations and requirements are understood, to contribute to technical architecture, and to implement the tests and automations that are involved in the software.  They also need to understand how users expect the software to work so they can test and develop along those lines.

Technologies involved in SDET are wide and varied, and can include JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, C++, Ruby, SQL, and testing softwares like Selenium or 

Median salaries in NYC for SDET: $73,000


### Support Engineer

Software support engineers works primarily as troubleshooting and technical support roles.  They field issues from the public, and either walk users through solutions, or create issue reports for the development or testing team.  They can also be responsible for creating troubleshooting documents and guides for users of the product. They may also lead workshops for users in the correct use of the product.

### Solutions/Sales Engineer

Solutions and sales engineering roles in companies can take on different forms. These engineers work with customers, usually companies, to identify their needs and deliver software to them. 

These engineers usually need a technical background to be able to fully explain and demonstrate software.  As most software companies rely on upgrade cycles and repeat business, solutions and sales engineers often develop relationships with their customers, and need an in-depth understanding of both their products and their customers evolving systems and needs.

They can also be responsible for training users in the use of their company's products, or the installation of said products on the customer's systems.  They might also spend significant time at the customer's location after installation to maintain and verify systems.

These positions can vary a lot in terms of pay and responsibility, and some may involve a lot of travel.
